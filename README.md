Hi, I'm YASH BORSE
👋 Hey there! I'm a final year B.E. student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. My current focus is on working with AI, ML, and web development projects. I'm constantly learning and exploring new ways to integrate these technologies into real-world applications.

🌱 My GitHub profile showcases some of my recent projects, including a machine learning model for SIGNATURE VERFICATION and a web application for FINANCE DASHBOARD. I enjoy building and sharing my work with the community and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.

💞️ I'm interested in working on AWS and Salesforce and exploring their capabilities in building scalable applications. I'm open to collaborating with other developers and contributing to open source projects.

📫 If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter.

😀 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking or reading up on the latest tech trends.

Here are some of the skills I've been working on recently:

Programming Languages: C++, JavaScript
Web Development: HTML, CSS, JS, VUE.
Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy
Cloud Technologies: AWS, Salesforce, GCP
